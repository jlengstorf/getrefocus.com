By using the exact same principles we'll teach you in **The Refocus Bootcamp**, we've both been able to find more balance, do work we're proud of, and design our lives around what's most important to us.

That means we have complete control over our schedules, freedom to work on projects that excite us, and plenty of time to spend traveling, improving our relationships, and focusing on our other passions.

Again, this 4-day training event is absolutely free.

We want to give you an inside look at what we’ve been working on — and the principles we’ve used to design our lives around what’s most important to us.  Plus, you’ll discover how **you** can start building more freedom, control, and meaning in your own life, too.

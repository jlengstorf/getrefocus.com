# Are you feeling stuck?

### Do you feel like you’re spinning your wheels, overloaded, or unsure what you should do next?

<p class="hero__lede">
    How many good ideas are you sitting on?<br>
    Are you drowning in unfinished projects?<br>
    Do you feel like you’re lacking direction?

## You can take back control...

### ...and feel more confident in your ability to choose, plan, and execute on anything.

If you’re reading this, it’s safe to say you’re an ambitious person. (Because — let’s be honest — unambitious people are not going to end up in this corner of the internet.)

In our experience, most ambitious people fall into two major traps:

1. They take on too much and drown in their work, projects, and other commitments
2. They get overwhelmed by possibilities and get paralyzed by choice

But there’s another move open to you: **you can train your internal compass to know which way to go so you’re always moving in the right direction.**

### What the hell does that mean?

A strong internal compass gives you the confidence to know what the right things are so you can say “no” to the wrong things. That means you do important work you can be proud of — and have plenty of time for the things that matter most.

To train your own internal compass, you need to:

-   **understand your purpose** and what you actually want to accomplish
-   **know what you truly enjoy** — and what you merely endure
-   **uncover your most valuable skills**, and learn where you should say no
-   **find the biggest time leeches** so you can take back wasted hours (or days)
-   **learn how to choose which ideas to pursue** — and which ideas to kill
-   **break big ideas down** into small action steps
-   **create highly productive habits** so you can handle a superhero’s workload on a slacker’s schedule — leaving more time for what matters

</div>

Nate is a writer and the “marketing and ideas guy” at Precision Nutrition, one of _Fast Company’s_ “Most Innovative Companies”. He’s been featured in _Men’s Health_, the Los Angeles Times, and Tim Ferriss’s blog. At least twice, Nate has (figuratively) burned down his entire life and started over because he was so overwhelmed.

Jason is a software developer, author, and armchair philosopher. He’s worked with companies like IBM, PlayStation, and Gatsby. He’s also a recovering workaholic who worked 90+ hour weeks until his dang beard fell out.

These days, we both have careers we enjoy, strong communities and friendships, reasonable and flexible work schedules, and we generally spend our lives feeling focused, relaxed, and happy.

We don’t have everything figured out. Probably we don’t know shit about shit in the grand scheme of things. But **we do know how to build a strong internal compass.**

And we want to share that with you.

## You’re not hopeless. Not lazy. <br class="hero__desktop-only">You’re just...stuck.

Maybe you don’t feel like you have a purpose or direction.

If you’re anything like us, you’ve always been the “driven” one among your circle of friends. The ambitious one. The one destined for big things.

If so, we’re willing to bet that if you're stuck right now, you’re not sitting around waiting for something to happen.

Instead, you’re trying to figure things out.

Trying to stay positive, trying to learn, trying to grow, trying to become better.

Maybe you’re spending lots of time on self-development:

-   Listening to podcasts
-   Reading psychology and business books
-   Following online tutorials or other training materials
-   Watching TED talks
-   Brainstorming ideas for what you could do next

But right now, if you’re being honest with yourself...maybe you feel like you’re nowhere near where you thought you shold be by now.

Maybe your self-confidence is lower than it’s been in years...and you’re having a hard time figuring out what direction to move in next.

Maybe you even feel like a fraud...like you can’t live up to the high expectations you’ve set for yourself.

### Maybe it’s a job.

A job you were once happy to accept...but are now ready to leave.

Even though the money is good — enough to pay your bills, more than most of your friends make — you know you don’t want to work there for the rest of your life. Or even the next couple of years.

The commute, the feeling of punching a clock, the feeling of your heart not being in it...even thinking about it stresses you out.

### Or maybe you’re not an employee.

Maybe the hustle is keeping you from sleeping.

You know that as soon as you get up, you’ll be bombarded with problems. Lots of fires to put out — and not nearly enough time to handle them all.

Running your own business has you riding the emotional rollercoaster, feeling the highs and the lows.

**The highs:** Good ideas, ambition, action, results, money.

**The lows:** Stress, lack of motivation, disappointment, money.

**Also: The sinking realization that your professional life has completely taken over your personal life.**

Because even when you’re not supposed to be working..._you’re still working_.

Planning. Worrying. Always trying to stay one step ahead.

### If this sounds familiar, you’re at a crossroads.

And soon — very soon — you’re gonna have to answer this question:

> “What am I going to do next?”

## What _not_ to do next:

### The 3 biggest mistakes ambitious people make when they feel stuck.

{{% color-box number="Mistake #1" heading="Getting caught in the “Self-Development Trap”" icon="/images/refocus-mistake_trap.svg" %}}

Think about this for a minute: In the past three months, how many...

-   Tutorials or blogs have you read?
-   Podcasts have you listened to?
-   Business or psychology books have you read?
-   TED Talks or YouTube videos have you watched?

Now, in the past three months, how many:

-   Worksheets or thought-exercises have you spent hours working through?
-   Action steps have you deliberately (and consistently) taken?
-   Mentors or coaches have you worked with directly?

What’s the balance between these two categories look like for you? What’s the ratio?

This is the difference between _passive_ learning, like podcasts, and _active_ learning, like working through a series of exercises and implementing them into your life.

It shows where most ambitious people go wrong: They spend most of their free time listening, reading, and watching...but almost ZERO time _doing_.

They get caught in what we call the “Self-Development Trap”.

That’s when we passively listen, read, and watch self-development material...but **rarely take meaningful action that matches who we are and what we want to accomplish.**

Don’t get us wrong: books, podcasts, and articles are great. The curiosity and drive for continued learning are critical to becoming the best version of ourselves.

They’re just not enough on their own.

To _really_ learn something — to truly understand it and be able to apply it in your own life — **you need to do it.**

To be able to design our lives around what matters most, we have to understand that there’s a difference between learning about the success habits of other people...and creating and practicing our own success habits.

{{% /color-box %}}

{{% color-box number="Mistake #2" heading="Following your passion (or thinking you have to follow it)" icon="/images/refocus-mistake_passion.svg" %}}

We have a friend who, a few years ago, decided to “follow his passion” and open a gym. Before that, he was a personal trainer at a local health club; he made good money and worked flexible hours.

But opening a gym seemed like the natural thing to do, the next logical thing in line.

It was a mistake.

Three years later, he’s one of the most stressed-out people we know; plus, he’s thinking of closing down and starting over in a different industry altogether.

He followed his passion...and got burned.

This happens _way more often_ than the stories we hear about someone quitting their job, “following their passion”, and creating a thriving, profitable business.

And that’s because “follow your passion” is dangerous advice for at least three reasons:

### #1. Most people don’t have a passion.

Ask your friends who love their jobs (if you have any) if they knew it was their passion before they started. Chances are, they discovered it was something they were passionate about _after_ they had been doing it for a while and became good at it.

This idea that you must have a passion to follow keeps many people stuck exactly where they are — because they can’t think of anything to pursue.

### #2. Most passions don’t translate to careers that make money.

If you do have a pre-existing passion, it doesn’t automatically mean it’s a viable career path. Just because you’re passionate about bread doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy being a baker. Just because you’re passionate about “helping people” doesn’t mean you should be a life coach.

This is also a great example of what happens when people leap...without having a plan in place.

They decide to quit their job, leave their career, cash out their retirement, and put everything they have into a new business they’re “passionate” about...and then they struggle and eventually fail (or give up) when they can’t get their business off the ground.

### #3. The most successful people who end up loving their work DID NOT follow their passion.

Instead, they became devoted to a skill and got very, very good at it. (More on this in a minute.)

Eventually, they were so good that they started to love their work.

They started to _become_ passionate about it.

{{% /color-box %}}

{{% color-box number="Mistake #3" heading="Continuing to hustle while hoping that things get better." icon="/images/refocus-mistake_hustle.svg" %}}

Here’s how it goes:

Amber works a job she doesn't really enjoy (but the paycheck is decent)...

She works long-ass hours and barely has enough time for the other important parts of her life (family, friends, hobbies, physical health, sleep)...

Amber’s aware of all of this, “knows it needs to change”, and maybe even complains about it (to herself or other people)...

And yet, Amber stays at the job (can’t be a quitter)...doesn’t form a plan to get out (she’ll “figure it out” later), and continues to work her ass off while hoping that maybe, somehow, something will change and things will eventually be different.

Maybe after the holidays are over. Maybe next month. Maybe if she just _pushes through_ and _works really hard_...

We don’t have to tell you all the reasons why this is a mistake: Amber is an ambitious person...but she’s waiting on something to change instead of initiating change.

She’s in the back seat when she really should be up front, driving.

{{% section type="body-copy" %}}

## At some point, we’re all guilty of making these mistakes.

We can’t even begin to tell you how many stupid “passion” businesses we started when we were younger.

Or how many hours we wasted listening to other people talk about how they became successful on their terms...instead of doing what we needed to become successful on _our_ terms.

But while most people around you will stay stuck on the hamster wheel — giving their lives to their careers, allowing other people to control their schedules — **there are people out there who decide to design their life around what matters most.**

These people understand, on a deep level, what direction they should move to create more balance, control, and impact in their lives.

They know how to narrow their focus on what’s most important. They understand how to be successful in their professional lives — _without sacrificing their personal lives._

But they don’t do it by _passively_ learning.

They don’t do it by “following their passion.”

And they don’t do it by working harder and longer at the expense of everything else in their lives.

Here’s how they do it...

{{% /section %}}

{{% section type="body-copy" %}}

## The key to designing your life around what matters most.

How is it possible to do rewarding and impactful work...while still maintaining balance in your life?

How is it possible to be successful both professionally _and_ personally?

**Here are two of the biggest lessons we learned as we made the transition from a couple of kids with big dreams and go-nowhere ideas...to slightly-larger kids with _complete control over what we do, why we do it, when we do it, where we do it, and who we do it with_.**

To design your life around what matters most — and give yourself the opportunity to live up to your full potential — you must begin to focus on two things:

{{% /section %}}

{{% section type="color-boxes color-boxes--habit" %}}

{{% color-box number="Success Habit #1" heading="You must switch to active-learning mode, at least 50% of the time." icon="/images/refocus-habits_active-learning.svg" %}}

Imagine a huge university lecture hall: rows of chairs packed in theatre-style seating; long wooden desks; the sound of the professor’s words echoing off the walls.

See the hundreds of students, listening with rapt attention, nodding their heads: _“Yeah, that’s a really interesting idea...I should do that.”_

That’s us, listening to a podcast or reading a book.

Now imagine a small table with 10 people around it, every person with a piece of paper in front of them. The professor who’s leading the group just gave them 30 minutes to complete an exercise.

When the students write, they do it feverishly, like the ideas are just spilling out of them. When they’re not writing, they recline back, thinking, contemplating, _“How can I do... what if I try…”_

Which group do you think is actually going to _use_ the information they’re learning?

Which group do you think is getting a richer, more valuable experience?

We’re betting on the people at the small table; the ones writing their asses off.

This is the difference between passive learning (lecture hall) and active learning (small group).

The people who are successful in designing their lives around what matters most spend just as much time (if not way more) working, creating, and implementing — as they do listening, reading, and absorbing.

Another way to think about it:

There’s a _big_ difference between listening to someone else’s business plan...and creating your own.

And there’s a HUGE difference between creating a business plan..._and following the plan, revising it along the way to overcome obstacles, and learning how to take advantage of new opportunities._

You want to do the latter.

{{% /color-box %}}

{{% color-box number="Success Habit #2" heading="You must identify and grow a set of valuable skills." icon="/images/refocus-habits_valuable-skills.svg" %}}

This is the opposite of “follow your passion.”

The way to eventually love your work — _and the way to eventually control your time and create more balance in your life_ — is to identify, develop, and master valuable skills.

There are actually two parts to this:

**The first is to develop a skill (or set of skills) that are valuable to other people and transferrable.** This is what Cal Newport calls “career capital”. By building a set of skills that other people find valuable — skills that are also transferable to different careers and industries — you’re setting yourself up for long-term success. Eventually, as you continue to grow and refine your skills, you’ll be able to exchange your skills for things like money, freedom, autonomy, and control.

**The second part is to develop a set of personal skills (or habits) that you can lean on for the rest of your life.** Skills like learning how to make tough decisions, deconstructing big goals and projects, overcoming procrastination, and _focusing_.

> If you were to start with just those two things — active learning and cultivating valuable skills — the results would be powerful.

Your “before” and “after” would be dramatic as hell.

## We know what it’s like...

We’re sharing this with you because we know what it’s like to feel stuck and directionless, too.

It’s not like we woke up yesterday and immediately had control over our schedules or knew where we wanted to take our careers.

Jason had to work some crappy, depressing jobs while he was trying to start his own freelance web design business. Nate had to learn how to keep his ambition healthy and productive — and not let it take over his entire life and ruin his relationships.

When we first started, we didn’t know anything about “active learning.” We had no idea how to find and develop “our most valuable skills”.

We didn’t even know that stuff was important.

**At that point, our most valuable skills were:**

-   Starting new projects and giving up
-   Working crazy hours and burning out
-   Drinking beer and complaining

But as we continued to work and invest in ourselves, _we continued to figure things out._

Over the last 10 years, we’ve continued to invest thousands of hours (and thousands of dollars) learning, building, and refining these skills for ourselves.

We know what it’s like to make the transition from _“I feel like I have no direction”_ to _“I know exactly where I’m going and how to get there.”_

{{% /section %}}

{{% section type="body-copy" %}}

## You can build the same level of direction, control, and confidence into your life.

And you can do it _way_ faster than we did.

Imagine what it would feel like to do work you’re proud of and focus on the things that _really_ matter. To have more balance in your life. To overcome procrastination and self-sabotage.

Imagine what it would feel like to have that _confidence_ and _purpose_.

We wanted something that would teach us how to make better decisions. Something that would help us figure out our own direction. Something that matched our ambition and our priorities.

Not just passive learning, like reading a book or listening to a podcast...but something that was hands-on and practical. **Something we could use — and immediately start to see results.**

Year after year, as we continued to learn and grow...as our careers continued to develop and lead to more opportunities..._we built our own system._

Of course, we didn’t think of it as a system back then. It was a chaotic mess of great ideas and best-practices, some written down and some stuck in our heads.

**Eventually this “system” became a carefully curated vault of tactics, frameworks, ideas, exercises, and worksheets to help us control our future and continually design our lives around what mattered most.**

And we were happy.

At this point, we were doing the things we wanted to do, and living the way we wanted to live.

But then something interesting started to happen: _people started asking us for advice._

But not advice on fitness or writing (which are Nate’s specialties). And not advice on web design and development (which are Jason’s specialties).

_They started asking us for advice on finding direction, balance, focus, and purpose:_

    <figcaption class="body-copy__figure-caption">
        We started receiving emails, messages, and comments like these.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

**Eventually, we were hearing from so many people that wanted our help...that we decided to create _the very thing_ we wished we’d had early in our careers.**

We decided to take the most important aspects of everything we’ve learned over 10+ years of designing our own lives — every valuable thing learned from mentors, coaches, and our own experience — _simplify it, sequence it, and put it together into one complete, step-by-step system._

### The step-by-step system that shows you how to take control of your schedule, uncover your most valuable skills, create more balance in your life, and start doing work that _really_ matters.

{{% /section %}}

{{% section type="body-copy" %}}

Refocus is an active learning toolkit that walks you through everything you need to start designing your life around what matters most. If you’re willing to do the work, Refocus offers you a step-by-step process to help you move your life (and career) in the direction you _really_ want it to go.

{{% /section %}}

{{% modules %}}

{{% section type="body-copy" %}}

We cover _everything_ we’ve learned that can help you to start reaching your full potential — from how to take control of your schedule and uncover your most valuable skills...to how to create more balance in your life and start to doing work that really matters.

**Here’s a brief look at what’s included in Refocus:**

<h3 class="body-copy__whats-inside">30+ in-depth video lessons with transcripts.</h3>

Each video series teaches you a valuable new skill and walks you through the process of exactly how to implement what you’re learning into your own life — _immediately_.

<h3 class="body-copy__whats-inside">Hands-on worksheets, exercises, and cheat sheets.</h3>

_Refocus_ goes deep into the specifics of _your_ life and what _you_ want to accomplish. This isn’t a passive course where we just teach you some “cool ideas.”

Instead, we give you **real hands-on activities and exercises** that show you how to take control of your life, piece by piece.

Feel trapped and consumed by time-wasting activities? There’s an exercise for that.

Don’t know how to turn your big idea into action steps? There’s an exercise for that.

Struggle with procrastination and staying focused? There’s an exercise for that.

Not sure which direction to go or what skills to develop? There’s an exercise for that.

Need to find more balance and stop feeling overwhelmed? You get the idea.

<h3 class="body-copy__whats-inside">The exact systems and techniques we use to stay incredibly effective.</h3>

Things like:

-   **Your Acceptance Criteria**: A set of specific, personal rules that will guide every decision you make and serve as your compass for which direction to move.
-   **The Highlander Technique**: How to make tough decisions and determine which opportunities to pursue—and which ones to ignore.
-   **The ATOM Technique**: A powerful way to transform ideas into action steps (some of the world’s most innovative companies use this exact same principle).
-   And a lot more...

<h3 class="body-copy__whats-inside">Lifetime access to everything.</h3>

_Refocus_ comes with lifetime access. That means you can take a break from the material if you’re out of town, on vacation, or just get super-busy for a few days. Sometimes life gets in the way, and that’s OK. _Refocus_ will always be here for you when you’re ready.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will _Refocus_ Work For Me?

#### What if I’m thinking about switching careers or starting my own business?

If you feel like you need to make a change or transition — even if you don’t know where to start — _Refocus_ can help you. You don’t need to know _exactly_ what you want to do next with your career or your life.

In the first two modules, we dive deep into your schedule and your values to help you uncover what’s _truly_ important to you (it’s often different than you think…). We also take you through a process to help you figure out your most valuable skills. And once you get clear on these, ideas for what you should do next generally come quickly.

#### What if I want to stay at my job and NOT start my own business?

That’s fine. If you need to learn how to manage your time better, improve your productivity and focus, or simply strike a better balance between your personal life and professional life, _Refocus_ can help. No need to leave your job or start a business.

#### What if I’m busy? Will I have time for this?

We created _Refocus_ to be a helpful addition to your life. If you can dedicate an hour or two a week, that’s all you need. And if you can’t do that, you have lifetime access to all the material — you can come back to it whenever you have time.

### I’m Wondering About...

#### What if I try _Refocus_ and decide it’s not for me?

We stand by this course with a 100% money-back guarantee. Because these are the same systems and frameworks we use every day, we know this material works. So we can take on the risk ourselves. Try the entire course and decide if it’s right for you. If you follow the steps we lay out in the course and don’t get the results you’re looking for, email us, show us you did the work, and we’ll refund your order in full.

#### What if I get busy and can’t finish?

_Refocus_ isn’t a “course” in the traditional sense. You don’t “finish” it. It’s a toolkit that you’ll continue to use over time, whenever it’s necessary. Think of this less as a class and more as a resource.

## Is _Refocus_ right for you?

We want to be clear: _Refocus_ isn’t for everyone. Because it’s an active learning process that shows you exactly how to create more balance, direction, and purpose in your life, you _will_ be required to think critically.

It will sometimes be challenging. But it will _always_ be rewarding.

We’d rather have a small group of dedicated people who are ready to take action instead of a large group of information-junkies who won’t put in the effort. So please read the following carefully to make sure this program is right for you.

## What kind of life do you want to build for yourself?

We’ve all been here before.

We close the book, finish the podcast, or walk out of the seminar...and we’re extremely motivated.

We’re gonna change everything! We’re gonna get serious! We’re gonna take action!

But what happens a few days (or hours) later?

What happens when we resume our normal lives, and get right back into our ordinary routines?

Our motivation disappears. And it doesn’t seem to resurface until we’re on to the next shiny thing.

But here’s the secret to motivation: When you have it, you must be willing to take full advantage of it. And when you _don’t_ have it, you have to start working and moving forward anyway.

### Motivation follows action.

That’s something every successful person we’ve ever known understands on a deep level.

The people who squander their motivation — or worse, the people who wait around for it to find them — will find themselves stuck in the same place forever.

**At this point, you have a choice:**

-   You can stop here, close this window, and go back to what you were doing before you started reading.
-   Or you can do the work to get unstuck, find direction and balance, uncover your most valuable skills, and start doing work that _really_ matters.

But whatever you choose, we want to encourage you to do two things.

### 1. Don’t make the same mistakes most ambitious people make at this stage.

Don’t get caught in the Self-Development Trap and waste all your free time learning the success secrets of other people. Continue to be a voracious learner, but don’t just do it passively. Instead, figure out what you need to do to make real change in your own life. Figure out how you can begin incorporating active-learning into your life. Because that’s when things will truly change for you.

Don’t follow your passion (or think that you have to). That’s how people make bad decisions, put unnecessary stress on themselves, and end up moving backwards. Instead, determine what skills you can develop and master that will allow you to live the life you really want.

Don’t work harder and longer and think that everything will magically change. Instead, get clear on what you can do to bring more balance into your life and make time for the other important things. Your schedule won’t change on it’s own. You have to take control yourself.

### 2. Choose to live up to your full potential — and take time to enjoy your life.

We’re one-third of the way through our lives. If we’re lucky, we’ve got another 40-50 good years before we die.

You may have the same amount of years left in you...or maybe even less. (And let’s be honest: None of us know how long we really have.)

So whatever you decide to do, do it well. Do it to the best of your ability.

Don’t settle for a job that sucks or a schedule that doesn’t allow you to have time to explore, take care of yourself, or see your family or friends. That’s a waste.

And above all, don’t forget this: You’re already an ambitious person. You already have most of what you need to be successful. And you can take steps right now to make your life exactly what you want it to be.

### Imagine what it would feel like to <br class="hero__desktop-only">do work you’re proud of and focus on <br class="hero__desktop-only">the things that _really_ matter.

To have more balance in your life. To overcome procrastination and self-sabotage.

Imagine what it would feel like to know what direction you want to go — and exactly how to get there.

You can do this. But you don’t have to do it alone. (We didn’t.)

You got this,<br />
Nate and Jason

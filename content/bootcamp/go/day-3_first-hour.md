## Video Transcript

You know those days when everything seems to go your way? 

From the time you wake up till the time you go to bed the day just hums along smoothly, like you have your own personal theme music. 

You look good, you feel good, you kick ass at work, you spend time with your family or your friends, you eat good food, you’re not stressed out...you’re just _winning the day_. 

But what about those _other_ days? 

The days where you’re stressed, overwhelmed, and frustrated. The days where you _said_ you were going to do something — go to the gym, finish work early, read a book, start working on that new business idea — but then...you just didn’t get around to it.

These are the days where your theme music sounds like something out of a sad Disney movie. 

Of course there are a million reasons why one day can go smoothly...while the next day can be shitty. And most of them are completely out of our control.

But there is at least _one thing_ within our control that can set us up for a successful day. 

And that’s owning the first hour. 

## The Power of the First Hour

How would it feel to accomplish something meaningful every single morning, within the first hour you woke up? 

How would it feel to tackle and overcome your most important task or project — with complete focus — within the first hour you sat down to work? 

When you own the first hour — whether that’s the first hour after you wake up, or the first hour you sit down to work — you set yourself up for success for the rest of the day. 

It’s like a small snowball, rolling down the side of a snow-covered hill. As the ball rolls, it picks up more snow — and with it, more momentum. 

Accomplish one important thing within your first hour, and the rest of the day falls right into line and runs smoothly. 

The best thing: this is a skill you can build, starting _right now_.

Learning how to own the first hour is a _foundational habit_.

It’s how we’re able to take care of our mental and physical health. It’s how we’re able to grow our relationships. It’s how we’re able to do work we’re proud of and handle a superhero’s workload on a slacker’s schedule — all while maintaining balance and finding time for the other important stuff in our lives. 

Of course, like everything so far in this bootcamp, we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible. There are many, _many_ layers to designing your life around what matters most. 

And in _Refocus_, we go through them all, step by step.

But right now, let’s take a look at how you can win the day, starting with the very first hour.

## How to Own the First Hour of the Day

The first hour of the day is the perfect time to do one of two things:

### 1. Practice any kind of lifestyle habit you’re currently trying to build.

Typical things include exercising, meditating, writing, reading, going for a walk, or spending time with your partner or family. But it could really be anything. 

This is usually a task or habit you’d likely skip or find that you don’t have enough time for later in the day. By putting it first, you’re acknowledging its importance in your life and you’re showing that you’re serious about actually doing it. 

### 2. Give your full attention to the one thing you decided to focus on in Lesson 2 of the Refocus Bootcamp. 

For instance, maybe after running the Tournament Technique a couple days ago, you decided the one thing that would make the biggest impact on your life right now is to make more money. Use the first hour of the day to dedicate to this. 

Your action steps for _how_ to make more money will be unique to you and your situation, of course. 

Maybe you’ll spend the first hour working on building your freelancing business. 

Maybe you’ll spend it studying how _other_ people make more money on the side. 

Maybe you’ll spend it building a new skill unrelated to your current career — like learning how to code or studying for your personal training certification. 

Or maybe you’ll use the first hour to build skills your employer finds valuable so you can stay in your same job, but negotiate a pay raise. 

Whatever you choose, the first hour of the day is the perfect time to invest in yourself, the people you care about, _and_ the skills you want to build. 

## How to Own the First Hour at Work

Ambitious people generally want two things when it comes to work: They want to do something that matters. And they want to work effectively and productively — that way they can accomplish what needs to be accomplished...and then shut down to focus on the other important parts of their lives. (And of course, making money is nice, too.) 

But just think about how most people work. 

They get distracted easily, either by their phone, Facebook, random videos or articles, or interruptions from other people. 

They procrastinate and waste time — even if they know they really should be getting things done. 

They work on all the little things that _feel_ important and give the illusion of progress...but they have trouble starting and focusing on the really challenging work that will actually move them forward. 

And they work much longer hours than necessary, expanding their day to a full 8, 9, or 10 hours...when they could have really been done in 3 or 4. 

By owning the first hour of your workday, you’re dedicating yourself to the work that actually matters. Usually this means picking one thing — usually something that involves a lot of critical thought or creativity — and focusing on it intensely.

Oftentimes, these are projects that will take longer than an hour. Sometimes much longer. 

But if you can focus — without distraction — on your most important task, you’ll make swift progress and the work will get easier and easier once you get into the flow. 

In _Refocus_, we walk you through an entire process with a detailed checklist to make sure you’re always focusing on the most important task.

But for now, here are three of the most impactful things you can do:

### 1. Run the Tournament Technique to find your most important task.

Oftentimes we know exactly what our most important task is — it’s usually the most challenging thing on our to-do list. 

But if you’re not sure what your most important task for the day should be, use the Tournament Technique that you learned in Lesson 2.  

List all of the things you need to do today, pair them up, and make them fight. The winner is your most important task and the thing you should focus on in the first hour. 

### 2. Remove your distractions.

Turn off your phone. Close your office door. Block your access to the internet. Tell people you’re unreachable. In short, do whatever you need to do to focus. 

Don’t worry; the world will still be there when you return. 

### 3. Race the clock.

Set a countdown timer for one hour, watch the minutes tick down, and put some pressure on yourself to perform. 

You can’t sit around and wait for “motivation” to strike; instead, you’re creating your own motivation by starting.

## Your First Hour Really Starts the Night Before

Here’s the truth: No one is automatically productive as soon as they wake up. Or if they are, they definitely weren’t born that way.

Instead, being productive and effective is a skill we each have to develop. 

That’s because it’s incredibly difficult to just get up and _go_. Most of us would much rather go back to bed or check Facebook or skip whatever thing we said we were going to do yesterday — especially if it’s challenging or uncomfortable to start today. 

Doing stuff that’s good for you is difficult. 

Your Past Self may have wanted to meditate, work out, and then start working on that big project. But your Current Self may not want to do any of that shit. 

That’s why you need to go one step further and protect your day from from self-sabotage by planning your first hour...the night before.

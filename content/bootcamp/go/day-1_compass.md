## What you'll learn:

In this video we'll show you a 2-step process for creating your own compass. 

When we _don't_ have a compass, we don't know which direction to move in; this is how we can begin to feel lost or stuck in a rut — in both our careers and in our lives.

But a compass changes all of that. No matter where we are, our compass always shows us our best next step.

Be sure to check out these key points:

* **The 2 things we _must_ know to build a life that matters. [5:00]**
* **Why writing down your values is useless—and what to do instead. [7:28]**
* **Why you should never "follow your passion" [9:10]**
* **How to love your work...and become extremely valuable in the process. [11:57]**

And don't forget: we'll be answering your questions live at next Monday's hangout session.

## Video Transcript

In a minute, we’re going to show you a simple two-step process to _create your own compass_, a powerful tool that you can use whenever you feel stuck — in your career or in your life — that will help you decide what direction to move in next. 

But first, what does it feel like to _not_ have a compass, to _not_ know which direction you want your life to move in? This is something we used to struggle with years ago...and it may be something you’re struggling with right now.

Here are two scenarios based on real readers — the names have been changed — but they’re very similar to the lives of hundreds of people we’ve heard from over the past few weeks. 

### Scenario 1: Steven, 32, climbed the corporate ladder (and now he wants down).

Steven’s been at the same job for the past few years. He doesn’t necessarily _hate_ it — after all, the money is good, and he even sort of likes his boss and his co-workers — but he knows he doesn’t want to be here forever. He worked hard to get this job and he actually enjoys the kind of work he does...but right now he simply doesn’t feel challenged or valued by the company. 

He feels like he’s going through the motions, punching the clock. Not only that, he’s ready for more freedom. He no longer wants his professional life to take over his entire life. (The weekends and long hours are getting old fast...especially because he has a wife and a two-year old son at home.) 

He has a few ideas that sound promising — find a new job, start freelancing, go back to school — but he’s not sure what direction to move in. 

Steven’s lost. He feels an overwhelming urge to do _something_ soon...but he has no idea whether or not it’s the _right_ thing. 

### Scenario 2: Amy, 29, started her own business to have more freedom...but she ended up building herself a prison. 

Amy decided to take control of her life, so she left her job and started her own business. The only problem? Running a business is _way_ more difficult and nuanced than she thought it would be. Of course, Amy knew there would be challenges — that’s why from Day 1 she’s been willing to make sacrifices and work her ass off. 

But she didn’t think it’d be like _this_. 

Starting her own business was supposed to allow her to help people _and_ to set her own schedule. But now Amy realizes she’s spending _way_ more time working than she ever did at her old job. (And making less money.) She’s neglecting her relationships and has almost zero time for herself. Even when she’s home or out with friends, she’s still stuck in her head, going over business problems and solutions — or, worse, checking email on her phone.

Amy knows something needs to change, especially if she’s going to make this business a success. She has a few ideas on how to move things forward — new product offerings, new marketing plans, and more — but she’s not sure which thing to go after. And if she’s being honest with herself...she’s no longer sure she even _wants_ to run her own business. Maybe it’d just be easier to get a job. At least then she’d have weekends off, guilt-free.

Just like Steven above, Amy’s lost and not sure what to do next. She feels an overwhelming urge to do _something_ soon. She just has no idea whether or not it’s the right thing. 

### OK, so what do these scenarios have in common?

Even though the Steven and Amy are in different situations, they share some similarities.

For instance:

* **Both Steven and Amy are ambitious and willing to work hard.** They know there’s something broken about what they’re doing now, and they want to figure out a way to fix it. They’re not slackers. They see a problem, and they want to solve it for themselves.
* **Both want to do work that matters.** They want to feel challenged. They want to feel like they’re helping people and contributing something valuable to the world.
* **Both want more control, freedom, and balance in their lives.** They both want more time, for themselves and for their family and friends. They want to spend less time doing stuff that drains them and more time doing things that energize them. 
* **Both feel stuck.** They’ve worked hard to get where they’re at, but now they need to move in a different direction. They’re just not sure what that direction is or how to get started. 

After hearing from hundreds of people in similar situations, it’s clear to us that Steven and Amy _don’t have a compass_. 

Should Steven quit his job and go back to school...or take the leap to open his own business? (Or should he stick with his job?) Should Amy keep hustling in her business...or should she abandon it, call it a learning experience, and try something different? 

When we don’t have a compass — when we’re like Steven and Amy — we’re lost. We don’t know the right direction to move in...so we just start walking in _any_ direction. (Or we stand still.) 

Not having a compass is how lots of people end up in careers they don’t like, working on things that don’t challenge them. It’s why they tend to feel overwhelmed by options, scared to take the first step. (Or their ambition gets the better of them and they try to take on too much.) 

There are simply too many things they _could_ do...and each one may or may not blow up in their face.

But a compass changes all of that. 

## The Two Things We Need to Know to Live a Happy, Balanced Life That Matters.

For our purposes, a compass is made up of two different things:

1. **The things that make life worth living.** These are the things we wish he had more time to do, and the things that usually get neglected when our lives get busy. Things like taking care of our health and fitness, growing our relationships, having time for self-development. 
1. **The things we’re really good at (or willing to work hard to get good at).** These are the skills we either already have (in some capacity) or the skills we’re willing to spend years developing and mastering. _These are also skills that are valuable to other people._ Once developed, these skills allow us to find jobs or create businesses that do good work and match the kind of life want to lead.    

**When we have a deep understanding of both the lifestyle traits we value and the skill(s) we want to master, we start to see our path open up before us.** It becomes obvious which way to go. We may not know _exactly_ how we’re going to get there...we may not know how long it’s going to take...we may not know all the specifics of how it’s going to work out...but we _do_ know we’re at least walking in the right direction. (And that’s more than 99% of people can say.)

Here’s the thing about compasses: Every single person has to build their own. No two are alike. What’s North for one person may be South for another. 

That’s why it’s absolutely critical to learn how to build your own. No one else can do it for you. 

## The Two-Step Process to Create Your Own Compass

What would it feel like to know, on a deep level, which direction you should move? To feel confident that you’re walking on the right path toward the things you _really_ want — more balance, more control, more impact — in both your career and your life? _What would it feel like to always know your next best step?_

**In _Refocus_ — our step-by-step system that shows you how to design your life around what matters most — we go _deep_ into your life and help you create your own compass. We dig into your daily schedule, help you restore balance by eliminating your biggest sticking points, and take you through a systematic process to help you discover your most valuable skills and start doing work that matters.** 

But right now, we want to help you get started. 

Even though we’re just skimming the surface of what’s possible, the two exercises below will help you build the beginnings of your compass (which is more than 99% of people have). 

Remember, a compass is made of up of two different things:

1. **The things that make life worth living.**
1. **The things we’re really good at (or willing to work hard to get good at).**

Let’s quickly explore each in a little more detail; and then we’ll give you a worksheet to help you get started. 

### Compass Component 1: The things that make life worth living.

Most of us, at some point in our lives, have written down the things we care about most. Our list probably looked something like this:

**Things That Matter:**

* My family
* My health and fitness
* My relationship
* My self-development and striving to be better

That’s cute. Unfortunately, it’s also useless. 

After all, how many people write down “my health and fitness are important to me”...and then don’t exercise, don’t eat well, don’t get enough sleep, and walk around constantly stressed out? (Health and fitness is usually the first thing to go when life gets busy.) 

How many people say “spending time with my family is important to me…” and then take a promotion at work that provides some extra money, but also takes them away from their family in the evenings and on weekends? 

In other words, how many people say something is important to them...but then don’t act as if it’s important at all?

The problem with simply listing the stuff that’s important to you is that it lacks teeth. There’s no deeper meaning. And there’s certainly no repeatable action step. 

To make our values mean anything — to find a way to consistently live them and not just talk about them — we need to go deeper.

The worksheet below will get you started. Simply download it, print it out, and write down the questions. Or, download it and pull up a Word document on your computer and answer them there.

### Compass Component 2: The skills we’re really good at (or willing to work hard to get good at).

The second part of our compass is knowing what we’re really good at — or at least knowing what we’re willing to work our asses off to _become_ good at.

We all know that building skills is important; that’s why people go to college, attend conferences, and buy books and courses. But why is developing — and eventually mastering — a skill or series of skills part of our compass?  Two reasons:

### Reason 1: You’ll (eventually) love your work. 

Author Cal Newport talks about this in his book _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_. While most people think they should “follow their passion” Cal argues that it’s actually a very dangerous thing to do for three main reasons.

**#1. Most people don’t have a pre-existing passion.**

Ask your friends who love their jobs if they knew it was their passion before they started. Chances are, they discovered it was something they were passionate about _after_ they had been doing it for a while and become pretty competent.

**#2. Most passions don’t translate to income-producing careers.**

If you do have a pre-existing passion, it doesn’t automatically mean it’s a viable career path. Just because you like surfing doesn’t mean you should open a surf shop. Just because you’re passionate about health and fitness doesn’t mean you’d be a great a personal trainer. 

Besides, very little of running a business about a thing is actually _doing the thing_; you won’t catch a lot of waves when you’re behind the counter trying to help a tourist choose the right surfboard, after all. 

**#3. The most successful people who end up loving their work _didn’t_ follow their passion.**

Instead, they became devoted to a skill and got very, very good at it. Eventually, they were so good that they started to love their work. They started to _become_ passionate about it. 

In his book, Cal shares an anecdote about Steve Jobs: 

> “If he really followed his passion in his twenties, he would have never built Apple computers; instead, he would have become a very popular teacher at the Los Altos Zen Meditation Center.”

In other words, _passion follows skill_. Not the other way around. 

So if you think you want to be a personal trainer, ask yourself: What skills does a great personal trainer have? Which one (or two) do I think are the most important? Hint: it’s not enough to know how to exercise and eat healthy yourself.

#### Another reason for developing and mastering a particular skill or series of skills: You can eventually exchange those skills for more of the things that make life worth living.

Now, there are two main ways to have more of the things that make life worth living. 

The first is to look at your current schedule and see if you can make any tweaks to find more time for them. So, if “spending time with the family” is important to you, you can immediately find small ways to free up your schedule in order to do this. (And in the Refocus online course, we cover how to do this in detail.)

The second way to have more of the things that make life worth living is to exchange your valuable skill(s) for them.

So, if something like “having autonomy and control over my schedule” is important to you, then you must be willing to trade a skill for it. Jobs and companies aren’t just handing out “autonomy and control.” _You have to earn them._

The reason that Jason and I are able to control our schedules at this point in our lives isn’t because we set out to control our schedules from the start (even though we badly wanted it).  

No, we’re only able to do it because we’ve been able to build skills that we can exchange for that control. (In other words, companies and customers are willing to pay you for your expertise — on your terms — _if_ you can help them solve a problem.)

You can see where most people get trapped. It’s really easy to have autonomy if you follow your passion of creating gingerbread sculptures of American Civil War battles — but if no one is willing to buy them, that autonomy doesn’t mean much at all. 

To eventually love our work — and to have the ability to trade that work for more of the things that make life worth living — we must develop a set of valuable skills. **In _Refocus_, we go deep into this  and focus on a few unconventional methods to help you discover your most valuable skills.**

But for now, the worksheet below will get you started. Simply download it, print it out, and write down the questions. Or, download it and pull up a Word document on your computer and answer them there.

## This Is Only the Beginning

As you can tell by now, building your compass is _not_ an overnight process. It takes critical thought and a deep analysis of what’s important to you, how you spend your time, and what your most valuable skills are. (And that’s only the beginning; once you have your compass, there’s a lot more to do.)

We go deep into detail on all of this in _Refocus_. 

But if you were simply fill out the two worksheets here in this lesson, you’ll put yourself ahead of 99% of everyone else around you. 

See you soon for Day 2, where we’ll share a ridiculously effective tool to help you narrow down your focus and pick your biggest and best opportunity — every single day.

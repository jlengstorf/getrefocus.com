## What you'll learn:

Ambitious people like us usually have _way too many_ self development goals. If we’re not careful, we can easily get overwhelmed and lose our motivation. And that’s when we start to compare ourselves to other people, lose our confidence, and stay stuck in the same position. 

In this video we'll show you how to escape that trap. We’ll also introduce you to a ridiculously simple and effective tool that will help you narrow down your focus and pick the **one goal** that will make the biggest impact on your life—right now. 

Be sure to check out these key points:

## Video Transcript

You know that overwhelming, suffocating feeling you get when you have too much stuff to do? 

It can happen on a _micro_ level, like when your todo list is too long and the day is too short.

For instance, maybe you want to the gym, meditate, do productive work, read a book, cook and eat healthy meals, meet up with friends, and still manage to get to bed at a decent hour. That’s a lot to deal with. 

(And this doesn’t even consider the demands _other people_ place on our time. People like our families, our friends, our bosses, and our clients.)

But it’s not just day-to-day stuff. This overwhelming, stressed-out feeling of having too much to do can affect you on a bigger, _macro_ level too.

For instance, let’s look at self-development.

The simple fact that you signed up for this bootcamp shows that you’re an ambitious person who always wants to learn and grow. 

Well, as an ambitious person, you likely hold yourself to a high standard, and have a lot of ideas on how to improve your life and make it better. You know you definitely don’t want to end up stuck on the same hamster wheel most of the people around you seem to be on.

While your ambition is a really good thing, it can also add a lot of goals, commitments, and todo items to your life.

And because ambitious people usually want to kick ass in _all_ aspects of life, that usually means the goals are extremely varied.

For example, here’s just a fraction of the things Jason and I have told ourselves we have to do the name of self-development over the last decade.

* Listen to hours of self-development podcasts
* Read dozens of business and psychology books
* Start our own businesses
* Try out freelance consulting
* Learn a new language
* Meditate
* Stay consistent in the gym
* Become a better partner to our significant others
* Get more sleep
* Wake up earlier

And, of course, we top it off with, “Make sure to slow down and take time to enjoy life.”

Sure. I’d love to — but _how will I fit that into this fucking ridiculous schedule?_

We don’t have to tell you: that’s a LOT of stuff deal with.

And if you’re like most ambitious people, you feel like you need to figure it all out...right now. 

As one person wrote in an email to us recently:

> “I sometimes feel overwhelmed, stressed, and overstimulated in the pursuit of my goals.”

Well, when we look at that list, it’s hard not to think… “Yeah, no shit.”

If we try to cram too much self-development into our lives...we end up crippling our _actual_ self-development. 

We take on too many things, we get overwhelmed, and we never make any _real_ progress. And so, we stay stuck exactly where we are.

That’s why to truly be effective — to truly grow and to  become better — we need to build a new skill. 

We need to learn how to _decide_. 


Decide: What goals should live...and what goals should die.

The ability to look at a long list of good ideas and decide which one is most worthy of your attention _right now_ is an incredible skill to have. And in a minute, we’re going to give you a fun tool to help you kickstart the process.

But first, let’s quickly take a look at the word “decide”. If you break it apart and look at the Latin root you get this:

**de** — off  
**cide** — to cut or to kill

You’ve heard this before: suicide, homicide, pesticide.

So when you’re deciding to do something, you’re really choosing what lives...and what dies. At least for now. 

Now, we’ve already discussed why this is a valuable skill to build: being able to decide helps you focus on the one thing that will make the biggest impact on your life right now. Instead of trying to start too many things and getting frustrated, you’ll instead line up the things you want to do one by one and knock them out.

But **how do you decide?** How do you pick what to focus on...and what to ignore? 

In _Refocus_, we go into extreme detail and show you step-by-step how to build this valuable skill. But right now you can start with the Tournament Technique.


## Introducing the Tournament Technique: A simple tool to help you focus on the most important thing.

For the past few years, we’ve used a simple tournament bracket in every facet of our lives—and it’s still amazing to us how effective it is. We’ve used it on big, important decisions (like what direction to take our career) and on small, annoying decisions (like what restaurant to go to for dinner).

Here’s how it works. 

In a single column, list _everything_ you’re currently telling yourself you should (or want) to accomplish. To keep it simple, here’s an example list we just made up:

* Meditate daily
* Write a book
* Start a business
* Go to the gym 4 days per week
* Get a better job
* Cut back on coffee
* Start a blog
* Get more sleep

This list doesn’t have to be in any kind of order. Just list everything you can think of as it comes to you.

Once you have everything listed you’re ready for the next step: start deciding. Take the first two items and put them head to head. In our example, the first two items are:

Meditate daily  
vs.  
Write a book

Again, whatever you put head to head may be unrelated. They may be from different parts of your life. That’s OK. 

You can only really focus on building one new skill or one new goal at a time. So it doesn’t matter what parts of your life they come from...you’re going to make them all fight until you’re left with one winner.

Now that we have our first two items it’s time to ask The Question:

> “If I absolutely had to pick just one of these to focus on...which one would make the biggest impact in my life right now?” 

And then you decide.

Sometimes it’s an obvious answer...and sometimes it will take you a few minutes or more to decide the winner. 

To keep with our example, let’s say we end up with something like this for our first set of items:

Meditate daily  
vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Meditate daily**  
~~Write a book~~

Again, this is just an example we made up. What you pick will be completely unique to you and your life right now. No one else can decide for you. 

After we put the first two goals head to head and come up with a winner, we just go down the list and repeat the process. 

Here’s what that may look like:

Meditate daily  
vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Meditate daily**  
~~Write a book~~

Start a business  
vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Start a business**  
~~Go to the gym 4 days per week~~

~~Get a better job~~  
vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Cut back on coffee**  
Cut back on coffee

~~Start a blog~~  
vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Get more sleep**  
Get more sleep



From there, you move on to Round 2. That’s where you’ll take your winners from Round 1 and put them head to head.

So, here’s the Round 2 list. 

* Meditate daily
* Start a business
* Cut back on coffee
* Get more sleep

And now we put them head to head:

~~Meditate daily~~  
vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Start a business**  
Start a business

~~Cut back on coffee~~  
vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Get more sleep**  
Get more sleep


You keep repeating this as many times as possible — pitting your winners from each round against each other — until you’re left with just ONE thing.

To finish our example, here’s one way our final round could end: 

~~Start a business~~  
vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Get more sleep**  
Get more sleep

Now, how did we end up here with “get more sleep” as the most impactful thing we can do in our lives right now? 

Easy. We made it up.

Remember: _your_ tournament bracket will be unique to you, based on your life and your goals. It will be much more difficult than what we just did. 

But let’s admit: it’s tough to start a business — or do much of anything, really — when you’re not getting enough high-quality sleep. 

So in our example, “Get more sleep” is the very first thing we’re going to tackle. 


## Now, at this point you probably have a question:

> “What the hell am I supposed to do with all the other stuff?”

Our answer: Nothing. At least for now.

Remember, it’s incredibly difficult to do two things at once — _especially_ if we’re trying to build new habits. 

So we recommend you either ignore your other goals completely while you focus on getting more sleep...or put your other goals in “maintenance mode” and do the absolute minimum necessary to keep them afloat.

You may not realize it yet, but having only one thing you’re focusing on can be a huge weight off your shoulders. 

You don’t have to try and keep up with a bunch of “self-development” things at once. 

Instead, you can pour your energy and attention into the one thing you determined will make the biggest impact on your life...right now. 

Once you tackle your most impactful goal and get it where it needs to be — in this case, consistently getting a good night’s sleep — _then_ you can either run the Tournament Technique again to discover your next goal, or you can simply backtrack and pick the next goal in line (which is usually the goal that lost in your final tournament bracket round).

Of course, at this point, your work is just beginning. After all, “Get more sleep” sounds good...but it doesn’t really mean anything either. It’s not specific enough. 

There’s a whole list of stuff you need to figure out before you can “get more sleep.” 

For instance, off the top of our head:

* How much sleep do you need? 
* When will you go to bed? 
* What if you share a bed with someone and you go to bed at different times? 
What techniques do you need to try or habits do you need to build so you can * start to sleep better? 

In _Refocus_ — our step-by-step system that shows you how to design your life around what matters most — we’ll show you how to take big ideas and goals, deconstruct them, and sequence them in the right order so you can actually follow through with them.  

But for right now, it’s important to celebrate your small win. 

If you run the Tournament Technique for yourself, you’ll end up with only one thing to focus on. You will end up with the one goal that you believe will make the biggest impact on your life right now. 

Instead of taking on too much, procrastinating, comparing yourself to other people, and feeling guilty about your lack of progress, you’ll have one goal to focus on with laser-like precision until it’s exactly where you want it to be.

And from there, you’ll pick the next in line and apply the same level of focus...until you’ve turned your list of goals into a list of accomplishments.

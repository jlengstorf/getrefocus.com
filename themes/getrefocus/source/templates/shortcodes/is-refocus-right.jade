      strong You’re simply looking for more information.
      |  In 
      em Refocus
      | , we cover a lot of information on self-development, productivity, balance, and doing work that matters. But this isn’t a passive-learning experience (like listening to a podcast or reading a book). We want you to take what you learn and actually apply it into your life — that’s why we made 
      em Refocus
      |  an 
      em active-learning
      |  experience. There are exercises to do and worksheets to fill out. This can sometimes be challenging and takes work.

      strong You’re not prepared to invest in yourself.
      |  Lots of people claim they want to improve their lives...but year after year, they stay the same. You need to be different. Everything we put into 
      em Refocus
      |  we learned because we were willing to invest in ourselves — both in time and in money. If you’re not prepared to put in the work, then 
      em Refocus
      |  is not for you.

      strong You’re unemployed.
      |  The reason for this is simple: If you’re unemployed, we don’t want you to add any unnecessary stress to your life. Investing in a program when you’re struggling to cover your basic needs is not a good decision. You need to get back on your feet first. The only exception is this: You have more than enough savings to invest in the course. Then you’re welcome to join.

      strong You’re considering making a big career / life move within the next year.
      |  If you want to do something different with your career or your life — even if you’re unclear on exactly what that should be or how to do it — then 
      em Refocus
      |  is a good fit for you. That’s because 
      em Refocus
      |  helps you figure out your direction. We dive deep into your life and help you uncover your most valuable skills, identify your biggest time-wasters and self-defeating tendencies, and show you how to put together a plan to make the change you need to make — even if you’re nervous to make it right now.

    li.is-refocus-right__item.is-refocus-right__item--right
      strong You want a system to follow — and are willing to play the long game.
      |  You know that change isn’t automatic and you’re not looking for a magic bullet. Instead, you know that if you work hard and do the heavy lifting up front, you’ll reap the benefits for the rest of your life.

    li.is-refocus-right__item.is-refocus-right__item--right
      strong You understand the difference between cost and value.
      |  Cost is how much money it takes to buy something. 
      em Value is the benefit you will gain after you use it.
      |  (Benefits like more money, time, energy, and confidence and less stress, indecision, self-sabotage, and overwhelm.) The $20 book that sits on your shelf is effectively worthless. The $20 book you used to make one positive change in your life is worth at least 10x what the book cost. If you agree with that, then 
      em Refocus
      |  is a good fit for you.

      strong You’re willing to invest in yourself.
      |  When you hear that Nate took out a $1,200 loan when he was 20 years old to go to a fitness seminar…or that Jason turned down a stable job and salary to build a freelance web-design business from scratch, your first thought isn’t 
      em “That’s ridiculous.”
      |  Instead, your first thought is: 
      em “Interesting. I wonder what that led to.”
